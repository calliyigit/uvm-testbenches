# 🧪 UVM Memory Verification Testbench

This repository contains a **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** testbench developed to verify a simple **memory RTL module**, created as part of my learning journey in functional verification.

## 📚 Source and Credits

This testbench is **based on the public UVM testbench architecture example from:**

🔗 [https://verificationguide.com/uvm/uvm-testbench-architecture/](https://verificationguide.com/uvm/uvm-testbench-architecture/)

I used this reference to study and practice:
- UVM testbench architecture and component connections
- Creating sequences and sequence items for memory read/write
- Implementing driver, monitor, scoreboard, and environment
- Stimulus generation and checking using TLM communication
- Interfacing with a SystemVerilog RTL module

## ▶️ Run on EDA Playground

You can run and simulate this UVM testbench online using the following EDA Playground link:

🔗 [https://www.edaplayground.com/](https://www.edaplayground.com/x/CS_U)

This allows you to quickly test and explore the testbench without setting up a local environment.
