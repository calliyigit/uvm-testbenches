# UVM Adder Testbench

This repository contains a UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) testbench for a simple **adder design**, implemented as part of my learning journey in functional verification.

## 📚 Source and Credits

This testbench is **based on the publicly available example from:**

🔗 [https://vlsiverify.com/uvm/uvm-adder-example/](https://vlsiverify.com/uvm/uvm-adder-example/)

I used this example to study:
- The structure of a UVM testbench
- Sequence, sequencer, driver, and monitor connections
- How data flows using TLM ports and analysis mechanisms
- How to use `uvm_subscriber` for coverage
