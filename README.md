# ALU UVM Testbench

This repository contains a UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) testbench for a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) design. The testbench is developed as part of my learning journey in functional verification and SystemVerilog UVM methodology.

## ðŸ“š Source and Credits

This testbench is inspired by and developed following the tutorial video:

## What You Will Learn

- The basic structure of a UVM testbench including environment, agent, driver, monitor, sequencer, scoreboard, and test.
- How to use virtual interfaces and UVM configuration database (`uvm_config_db`) to connect DUT signals with testbench components.
- How to implement sequences and sequence items to drive stimulus.
- How to implement a scoreboard for result checking.
- Handling synchronization and stimulus generation for an ALU module with basic operations.
- Running the testbench with a simple ALU RTL design.
