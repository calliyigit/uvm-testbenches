# DFF UVM Testbench

This repository contains a UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) testbench for a simple synchronous D Flip-Flop (DFF) design. The testbench is implemented as part of my learning journey in functional verification and SystemVerilog UVM methodology.

## ðŸ“š Source and Credits

This testbench is inspired by and developed following the tutorial video:

## What You Will Learn

- The basic structure of a UVM testbench including environment, agent, driver, monitor, sequencer, scoreboard, and test.
- How to use virtual interfaces and UVM configuration database (`uvm_config_db`) for connecting DUT signals with the testbench components.
- How to implement a simple sequence and sequence item to drive stimulus.
- Basic coverage and scoreboard concepts (can be extended).
- Running the testbench with a simple synchronous reset D Flip-Flop module.
